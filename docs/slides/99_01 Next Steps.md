Hey there, it's Ray again. Thanks for watching this course.

D3 is extremely deep and this is just an introduction to the main components,  so if you want to learn more, make sure you look at the d3 documentation.  You can find the  official site here. https://d3js.org/

But if you want to dig into what it can do, check out the API documentation at this URL

https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md

You should also check out the Github project for this course. It has the lastest version of the code for this course.

If you want to learn more about me, you can reach me at my personal site raybo.org or through twitter, github, linkedin or about any other social media network @planetoftheweb.

Once again thanks for watching this course...and have fun learning.
