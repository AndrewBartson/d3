Hey there, this is Ray Villalobos, senior staff author...

In this course, I'm going to introduce you to the basic components of the D3 framework and we'll do this by building a bar chart step by step.

We'll start by understanding what D3 is and learning to work with selecting and manipulating HTML DOM elements. Then, we'll do a quick introduction to SVG, so that you can understand how D3 creates elements using Scalable Vector Graphics.

Once we understand that, we'll break into the basics of scales, which D3 uses to create streams of information. There are many types of scales in D3 and we'll cover linear, ordinal and time based scales.

We'll also learn how to add events so that our scales can respond to regular DOM events and how to animate our SVGs for a more dramatic effect.

Finally, I'll show you how easy it is to import data with d3. We'll create a bar chart that tracks temperatures over a period of time.

There's a lot to learn, but that's why you're here, so let's get started.
