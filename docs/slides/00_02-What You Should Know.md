This is not beginner course, so there's a few things you should be comfortable with before you take this course.

I'm assuming you already know HTML and CSS pretty well are generally comfortable building websites.

You should also be pretty comfortable with JavaScript, so if you need help with that, check out JavaScript Essential Training.

You should know how to work with modern build tools like Github and GulpJS, if you need help with that, check out the course Web Project Workflows with GulpJS, Git and Browserify as well as Up and Running with Git and Github.

If you feel comfortable with these requirements, then it's time to get started.
